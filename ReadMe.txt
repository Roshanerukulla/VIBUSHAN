   This sign-up page is where the customers would add their credentials and their home address where they want their meal to be delivered.

4. After signing in, the customer will have two options, one of Ordering a meal and other of checking what they have ordered previoulsy.
   


6. The customer can select the dishes which they want by using the '+' and '-' buttons on the screen, and then checkout to the final page where they can see all the dishes they have selected.
   



8. We create a session when a customer logs in, so even though the page gets refreshed or closed the dishes selected by the customer remains same.

9. After, placing order on the checkout page, the customer can order more dishes or give us a review about their experience ordering food with us. We store this user review which would help us in building more better user connection.

3. We use a six-digit authentication code, which the Business owners can provide to new managers, so that they can set up new accounts. This helps in securing the manager side functions.
   ## Authentication code: 464646

4. After logging in, the manager has two options, one is 'Checking orders' and other of updating the menu. The Checking orders page gets reloaded every time when order is placed where the manager gets crucial information of the dishes ordered, their quantity and the customer address.
   

5. The manager can update the menu, the menu updates are swift and get reflected on the customer side very quickly.
